## Hardware setup

### PWM for speed/position control

PWM (pulse width modulation) is accomplished by Hardware Timer of STM32F103C8T6:
- TIM3 / Channel 1 / Output pin A6

PWM parameters: 
- Recommendeded the pulse frequency for hobby applications is 1kHz - 10kHz
 - Advantages: Good balance of performance and efficiency, minimal audible noise
 - Disadvantages: Requires faster switching components
 - Best for: General-purpose robotics, hobby projects, small to medium motors
- To achieve such pulse frequency, below calculation is needed

> Given the pulse frequency = 8kHz
> TIM3 frequency is fed from APB2 bus (16MHz)
> Resolution is decided = 1000 for a well balance between performance and calculation
> Quantum frequency (qf = 1000 * 8kHz = 8MHz)
> Prescaler value = 2

*Note: value will be adjusted based on actual performance*
